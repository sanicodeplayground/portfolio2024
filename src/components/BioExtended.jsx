          As a developer
        </h3>
        <p>
          I pay close attention to my code’s readability. Sure, I’ll put
          together something as quickly as possible to make it work, but after
          that I’ll spend a good amount of time commenting and organizing
          everything. Mi casa es tu casa, I want you to feel welcome around my
          code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean, consistent, readable and maintainable code. It’s great when
          features work, but it’s even greater whenever they can stay that way,
          regardless of who’s working on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m excited to work on new projects, because I learn something new
          every time. I’m always excited for the next challenge!

          As a person
        </h3>
        <p>
          If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be resourceful. I’ll
          take a problem, break it into smaller bits and MacGyver myself a
          solution. Creativity has helped me sail around tough obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m curious by nature and I love learning. I’ve amassed a wide range
          of skills and interests that when put together, end up feeding my
          career in one way or another.
        </p>

          As a colleague
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’m a team player, with my background in business and law, I feel
          comfortable interacting with both the technically oriented people of
          the team as well as stakeholders. I will always go the extra mile to
          help my team.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience working for a small startup gave me exposure to the
          business side of a tech company, while at the same time delivering
          industry standard results on the production side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m always happy to pull an espresso shot and make some latte art for
          a colleague. I love to cook, so be on the lookout for the next
          potluck.
        </p>
        <p>Let's have a chat! I'd love to hear from you ☁️</p>
